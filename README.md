# Medical Provider Marketplace

This project is a prototype version of a Medical Provider Marketplace where people can find a doctor or other healthcare provider to book an appointment with. Users are able to search the marketplace for providers, see a list of all medical providers, and select a provider to book an appointment with. Inspired on a similar concept called [Zocdoc](https://www.zocdoc.com).
